This is my first job, I scooped ice cream.

I learned to clean. 

I learned how to make ice cream and ice cream related items, such as milkshakes, smoothies, waffle cones, and sundaes. 

I learned that sometimes, adults don't listen to you because they don't want to. I later learned it was because I was serving them. 

I learned that Baklava ice cream was gross. 

I learned that strawberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream tastes like a PB&J, and friends will exploit you for free ice cream.

This job did not pay well, and I embraced tips.

Cherry Garcia is still good.
